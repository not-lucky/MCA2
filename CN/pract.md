what is subnetting and subnet mask

## ASSISTANT

Subnetting is the process of dividing a larger network into smaller subnetworks, known as subnets. Subnetting allows for more efficient use of IP addresses and better management of network traffic.

A subnet mask is a 32-bit number used to identify which portion of an IP address represents the network portion and which portion represents the host portion. The subnet mask is applied to an IP address to determine which subnet the address belongs to.

For example, a subnet mask of 255.255.255.0 means that the first 24 bits of an IP address represent the network portion, while the last 8 bits represent the host portion. In this case, the network can have up to 254 hosts (2^8 - 2) on it.

Subnetting is a powerful tool in network design and administration, as it allows network administrators to optimize network performance, increase security, and improve overall efficiency.
