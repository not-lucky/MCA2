## ADT

- conceptual/mathematical model _ specifies diff. ops on that data type.
- doesnt specify how those ops implemented though.
- y called abstract??
  - cause of 2nd point
  - 2nd point is the concept of abstraction.
- EX- Stack, Q, List.
- OPS:
  1. Push
  2. Pop
  3. Display
  4. Peek

## Stack

- ADT _ LIFO basis.
- ele. pushed to the top.
- Applications:
  1. converting infix to postfix
  2. evaluating postfix exp
  3. reverse string
  4. parenthesis validation
  5. backtracking
